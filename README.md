## 🚀 Project Title  
# **VarshaRaksha**

*A hyper-local web app designed to enhance community resilience during monsoons by providing real-time alerts, AI-powered news, and a live map.*

---

## 📖 Project Description  

### ✨ Problem Statement  
Every monsoon, communities in Indian cities face two floods: one of water, and another of misinformation.  
During local emergencies like flash floods or power cuts, critical alerts on WhatsApp are buried under a flood of unverified news and panicked messages.  
There is no single, trusted source of truth — and people who need help have no efficient way to connect with neighbours who can offer it.

---

### 💡 Proposed Solution  
**VarshaRaksha** (meaning *“Rain Protection”*) is a hyper-local, real-time web application that replaces chaos with clarity.  
It acts as a digital bridge, connecting residents to verified information and each other.  

Instead of a single messy chat feed, **VarshaRaksha** structures communication into three actionable categories:  
- ⚠️ **Alerts:** Verified incidents like flooding or roadblocks.  
- 🙋‍♂️ **Requests:** Posts from people needing help.  
- 🤝 **Offers:** Help or aid offered by others.  

This transforms a noisy chat group into an organized, life-saving tool.

## 🎯 Target Users / Use Cases  

**Primary Users:**  
Residents of urban and suburban communities, especially in areas prone to monsoon-related disruptions (e.g., Hyderabad).

**Use Cases:**  
1. 🌧️ A resident can post an **Alert** with a photo and location to report a waterlogged street.  
2. 💧 An elderly resident can post a **Request** for drinking water during a supply cut, which a neighbour can respond to.  
3. 📰 Anyone can check the **Official Info** page to get a live, AI-generated summary of the day's weather news before stepping out.

- Designed a scalable architecture with **Firebase** to ensure real-time capabilities.  

### 3️⃣ Develop  
- Built using **React (with Vite)** for the frontend and **Firebase** for backend & authentication.  
- Integrated **Google Gemini API** for AI-powered summaries, **OpenWeatherMap** for weather data, and **React-Leaflet** for live mapping.  

### 4️⃣ Test  
- Conducted continuous manual testing and debugging to ensure smooth functionality.  
- Verified that the deployed version is stable and secure for users.  

### 5️⃣ Deploy  
- Hosted final demo using **GitHub Pages**.  
- Configured **GitHub Actions** & **Secrets** for secure, automated deployment.
