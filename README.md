  <em>VarshaRaksha — A hyper-local web app designed to enhance community resilience during monsoons by providing real-time alerts, AI-powered news, and a live map.</em>

## 📖 Project Description

✨ **Problem Statement:**  
Every monsoon, communities in Indian cities face two floods: one of water, and another of misinformation. During local emergencies like flash floods or power cuts, critical alerts on WhatsApp are buried under a flood of unverified news and panicked messages. There is no single, trusted source of truth, and people who need help have no efficient way to connect with neighbours who can offer it.

💡 **Proposed Solution:**  
**VarshaRaksha** (meaning *“Rain Protection”*) is a hyper-local, real-time web application that replaces chaos with clarity. It acts as a digital bridge, connecting residents to verified information and each other.  
Instead of a single messy chat feed, **VarshaRaksha** structures communication into three actionable categories:  
- ⚠️ **Alerts (verified incidents)**  
- 🙋‍♂️ **Requests (for help)**  
- 🤝 **Offers (of aid)**  
This transforms a noisy chat group into an organized, life-saving tool.

🎯 **Target Users / Use Cases:**  
Residents of urban and suburban communities, especially in areas prone to monsoon-related disruptions (e.g., Hyderabad).  

**Use Cases:**  
1. 🌧️ A resident can post an "Alert" with a photo and location to report a waterlogged street.  
2. 💧 An elderly resident can post a "Request" for drinking water during a supply cut, which a neighbour can respond to.
3. 🌦️ A person who has things that might come in handy to people in need for them can post a "Offer" for the supply, to which a person who requires it can respont.
4. 📰 Anyone can check the "Official Info" page to get a live, AI-generated summary of the day's weather news.

## 🔬 Methodology
1. **Research & Ideation** – Identified gaps in hyper-local communication during emergencies based on real flood experiences in Hyderabad. Brainstormed a structured, real-time, and location-aware solution.  
2. **Design** – Prototyped the UI/UX focusing on simplicity and ease of use in crisis. Designed a scalable system architecture with Firebase for real-time functionality.  
3. **Develop** – Built with React (Vite) and Firebase, integrating Google Gemini for AI summaries, OpenWeatherMap for geocoding, and React-Leaflet for mapping.  
4. **Test** – Conducted manual testing and debugging throughout the development cycle to ensure stability and smooth user experience.  
5. **Deploy** – Hosted on GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions & Secrets configured for automated deployment.  
6. **Future Scope** –  
   - 🗺️ Safe Route Finder: Suggest safe travel routes using map-based community alerts.  
   - 🔔 Push Notifications: Real-time alerts for high-priority incidents nearby.  
   - 📴 Offline Mode: Access critical info like emergency contacts even during outages.
